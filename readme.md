# Golden Cheetah Python Chart wrapper
[Golden Cheetah](https://www.goldencheetah.org) (GC) is an analytic software that lets you get the value out of all your data.
This wrapper program is enabling you to build more advance python charts and debug them.

Within GC you can create python charts for more information on that look [UG_Special Topics_Working with Python](https://github.com/GoldenCheetah/GoldenCheetah/wiki/UG_Special-Topics_Working-with-Python)

This project is created based on GC version 3.5 


# Choose your favorite python IDE.
For this project I use PyCharm for download see [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/).
Once you have create a project and selected your desired python interpreter for easy interoperability use the same that is configured in GC.
